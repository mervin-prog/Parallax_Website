                “Living in accordance with nature” is a core principle that’s common across ancient Stoic teaching. But what do the Stoics mean by “Nature”?

Judging by the number of questions online, in articles, and on social media, the term “nature” seems to be an area of confusion for the Stoic community. Is it mother nature? Human nature? The natural order of things? Without a clear definition the term can be extremely subjective depending on who’s reading it.

Given that so many Stoic quotes and teachings recommend that we align ourselves with nature, we will get more benefit from these lessons when we find out what “nature” really means.

The Founder of Stoicism, Zeno of Citium wrote a piece of work called “On Life According To Nature”. 
However, like much of the work from the ancient Stoics, this has been lost to time, so we’ll have to look elsewhere for our answers.
Fortunately there are surviving works from the ancient Stoics that explain what they mean when they say “nature”.

Simply put, “nature” to the Stoics comprised of two things:

The nature of the universe

The nature of human beings 

In the book, Lives of The Eminent Philosophers, Diogenes Laertius writes:

“The nature according to which one should live Chrysippus takes to be both universal nature and, in particular, human nature. Cleanthes, however, holds that it is only the universal nature that should be followed, and not that of the particular.”

Cleanthes proposed that we should only concern ourselves with the nature of the universe. We should see the world for what it is, accept how it works, and act in alignment with it, rather than resisting it. For example, we might resent ageing, hate the winter, resist bad weather, or dislike the fact that delicious food is bad for our health. However, these are examples of the way the world works, we cannot change them, so we must align ourselves with them and act accordingly.

Chrysippus agreed but took this one step further. He believed that we should align ourselves with the nature of the universe, but that we should also align ourselves with human nature.

Chrysippus ultimately won this debate. Stoic “nature” concerns itself with both universal nature, and the nature of the human condition.
